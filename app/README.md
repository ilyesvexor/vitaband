Companion Flutter app scaffold

This folder contains a minimal Flutter app to be used as a starting point for the VitaBand companion application. It includes a simple UI and a placeholder for BLE integration.

To run:
1. Install Flutter SDK (https://flutter.dev).
2. From app/ run: flutter pub get
3. Run on a device or emulator: flutter run

Next steps: integrate flutter_reactive_ble or flutter_blue to scan and connect to the ESP32 BLE service UUID: 6E400001-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E
